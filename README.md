# NLP_Expense_tracker#
This App is meant to analyze your expenses via scanning your receipts.
It is Kotlin based and easy to use for almost every Android based Device.

How to use: 
Simply import the project into either Android Studio or install on your phone. 
Then simply open the app and go the the "Add Receipt" screen and choose either a photo from your gallery or take a new one.
If you checked the OCR output and confirm it, you can see the receipt addet onto your purchase history.
